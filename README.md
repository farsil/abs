# Arch Build System personal files
These are modifications to some packages provided by the [Arch Build System](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System), a feature of Arch Linux which is criminally obscure even in the wiki. These files are intended for personal usage, but you are free to use them if you like them.
